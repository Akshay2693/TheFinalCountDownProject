# TheFinalCountDownProject

A demo showing how to make a ProgressBar as a circular countdown using native Android components.

## Motivation

During a project where he needed to follow the design of a mockup where countdown was a stopwatch.
I did not want to use library for this, only native components, and all the demos I was looking 
for did not work the way I wanted, so based on the project [CountDownProgressView](https://github.com/kishorsinghgour/CountDownProgressView)
was done according to my needs and In my opinion, better
